# Diff-Oracle

## Data Preparation

The oracle-241 dataset is publicly available at [STSN](https://github.com/wm-bupt/STSN). However, the [OBC306](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2019.00114) and [Oracle-AYNU](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2019.00057) datasets are provided by other institutions and are not publicly accessible due to institutional restrictions.

Pseudo handprinted oracle character images can be generated via [CUT](https://github.com/taesungp/contrastive-unpaired-translation) by translating scanned data into handprinted data.

An example of JSON files required in training, including prompts, target and source filenames, is presented below:
